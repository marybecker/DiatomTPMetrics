##Abstract##

Anthropogenic phosphorus inputs are a major driver of cultural eutrophication in rivers and streams.  Cultural eutrophication is a serious threat to water quality.  It leads to numerous impairments including detrimental shifts in biological communities.  Phosphorus is difficult to identify as a cause of aquatic life impairment because it indirectly effects biological communities typically used for water quality assessment, such as macro-invertebrates and fish.  A method to diagnose phosphorus as a contributing cause of impairment was developed using a weight of evidence approach that includes diatom tolerance metrics to aid in identifying phosphorus as a cause of aquatic life impairment in State of Connecticut, USA, rivers and streams.  Biological tolerance metrics provide a measure of the sensitivity of aquatic organisms to anthropogenic disturbance.  State water quality monitoring programs have historically used tolerance metrics as a tool for assessing overall aquatic life impairment, but not as a diagnostic tool to identify causes of impairment.  Tolerance metrics were developed by combining the responses of individual diatom species along the observed phosphorus gradient in Connecticut.  These metrics were found to discriminate well between different levels of ambient phosphorus concentrations and had a greater response to phosphorus than alternative ecological gradients previously identified as affecting variation in diatom species composition, pH and temperature.  These results suggest that phosphorus-specific tolerance metrics are a useful tool that could be used to help identify phosphorus as a cause of aquatic life impairment.
