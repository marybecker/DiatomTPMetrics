## Diatom Tolerance Metrics to Identify Total Phosphorus as Candidate Cause of Aquatic Life Impairment in Connecticut Freshwater Streams

Biological tolerance metrics developed by combining responses of individual diatom species along the observed phosphorus gradient in State of Connecticut, USA.  Individual diatom species responses to TP were examined using generalized additive models and curve classification (Yuan 2004,2006). These metrics were found to discriminate well between different levels of ambient phosphorus concentrations and had a greater response to phosphorus than alternative ecological gradients previously identified as affecting variation in diatom species composition, pH and water temperature.
